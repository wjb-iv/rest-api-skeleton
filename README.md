# REST API Skeleton
Another learning project in Go.

Inspired by some great ideas that have come up at my day job, this sample demonstrates the use of the excellent [HTTPRouter Project](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) to produce a simple, yet sophisticated and feature-rich API server.

Also uses the [Cobra CLI Library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to demonstrate command line server started with various configuration flags.
